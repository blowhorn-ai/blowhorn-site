# Blowhorn for Grok

> Grok in your terminal can run commands. Hand it the Blowhorn CLI and it turns a sentence into a launch plan you approve.

## How it works

1. Install Blowhorn for Mac and the Blowhorn browser extension.
2. One instructions file, any Grok agent: However you run Grok, it needs blowhorn on the PATH and a short instructions file. Use AGENTS.md if your setup reads it; otherwise paste the block into its project instructions.
3. Say what you want. Grok turns it into blowhorn commands, and you approve what publishes.

`AGENTS.md`

## Blowhorn

You can run the blowhorn CLI. Prefer --json.
- What is due: blowhorn schedule list --due-only --json
- What is queued: blowhorn content list --pending --json
- Amplify a live post: blowhorn post --platform <p> --amplify <url> --profile all --dry-run
Ask me before any command without --dry-run that publishes.
```

## Try saying

- "Our launch post is live on X. Dry-run a repost from every profile on this computer."
- "Find the latest posts mentioning our project since Monday and list the ones worth a reply."
- "Write tomorrow's X row in my voice from this changelog and leave it unapproved."

## Commands

```bash
blowhorn post --platform x --profile all --amplify "https://x.com/<handle>/status/<id>" --dry-run
blowhorn find --platform x --query "blowhorn" --since 2026-10-12 --limit 25
blowhorn content list --pending --json
```

## Where it pays off

- **The sound wave**: One post goes out, then every profile you and your team run repeats it from their own computers. Grok fires the amplify; Blowhorn coordinates who does what.
- **Listening**: blowhorn find searches posts with filters for author, mentions, language and dates, so Grok can bring you the conversations worth joining.
- **In your voice**: Posts go out from your own accounts in your own browser, not from a bot account.

Blowhorn never votes.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#questions}

**Which Grok tool do I need?** Any Grok setup that can run shell commands on your computer. Blowhorn only needs a CLI call.

**Is amplifying everyone at once a good idea?** Use --dry-run first, then let it go. Blowhorn paces actions and coordinates the fleet so the same post isn't sent from two computers.

**Does my agent see my social passwords?** No. Blowhorn posts through your own signed-in browser; the agent only runs commands and reads their output. Review what you allow it to run, as with any tool that acts on your accounts.

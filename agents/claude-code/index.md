# Blowhorn for Claude Code

> Claude Code already lives in your terminal. Give it the Blowhorn CLI and a skill, and it runs your launch while you review the diff.

## How it works

1. Install Blowhorn for Mac and the Blowhorn browser extension.
2. Teach it once with a skill: Claude Code loads project skills from .claude/skills/. Add one that lists the blowhorn commands, says reads take --json and writes pass the row fingerprint back. Allow read-only commands in .claude/settings.json and leave publishing on ask.
3. Say what you want. Claude Code turns it into blowhorn commands, and you approve what publishes.

`.claude/skills/blowhorn/SKILL.md`

```markdown
---
name: blowhorn
description: Schedule, queue and amplify social posts with the blowhorn CLI
---

Read before you write:
- blowhorn schedule list --json
- blowhorn content list --pending --json
- blowhorn schedule status --json

Write with the fingerprint you just read:
- blowhorn content upsert --payload '<json>' --row N --expected-fingerprint <fp> --json

Preview anything that publishes with --dry-run first.
If anything looks wrong: blowhorn schedule pause --all --reason "<why>"
```

`.claude/settings.json`

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(blowhorn schedule list:*)",
      "Bash(blowhorn schedule status:*)",
      "Bash(blowhorn content list:*)",
      "Bash(blowhorn analytics:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Try saying

- "Read my pending content queue and tell me which rows are owed to which profiles before Tuesday."
- "Add a LinkedIn row for your personal profile: announce the v2.4 release, approved, promote on 2026-11-10 09:00:00. Show me the payload first."
- "Our post just went live at this URL. Dry-run an amplify from every profile on this computer, then wait for my go."
- "Something is off with LinkedIn. Pause the whole fleet and tell me the reason you recorded."

## Commands

```bash
blowhorn content list --pending --json
blowhorn content upsert --payload '{"Platform":"linkedin","Profile":"personal","Message Text":"v2.4 is out","Approved?":"yes","Promote On":"2026-11-10 09:00:00"}' --json
blowhorn post --platform linkedin --profile all --amplify "<post-url>" --dry-run
blowhorn schedule pause --all --reason "LinkedIn challenge"
```

## Where it pays off

- **Release day from the PR**: Have Claude Code turn the changelog it just wrote into one queue row per platform, ready for approval.
- **Headless runs**: claude -p runs a prompt from a script, so a morning check of what's due lands in your terminal.
- **The weekly read-out**: Let it pull blowhorn analytics history --json and write Friday's summary for you.

Blowhorn never votes.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#questions}

**Does Blowhorn ship an MCP server for Claude Code?** Yes. Add the Blowhorn MCP server to Claude Code and it can find and use every Blowhorn action, with your limits and approval rules attached. Prefer the shell? The CLI speaks --json, so a skill and an allowlist work too.

**Can it publish without asking me?** Only if you allow it. Keep blowhorn post and schedule trigger-now off the allowlist and Claude Code asks every time.

**Does my agent see my social passwords?** No. Blowhorn posts through your own signed-in browser; the agent only runs commands and reads their output. Review what you allow it to run, as with any tool that acts on your accounts.
